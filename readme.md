# SFML 3D Test

This project is created for testing purposes. 
Let's see if I can get some 3D scene setup with OpenGL and SFML. 
I'll be using the default OpenGL library included with SFML. 
I have previously managed to get a cube to show up on the screen with FreeGLUT but it was a long time ago. A long, long time ago.
